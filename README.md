# Planetary Workbench

The Planetary Workbench is a multi-platform toolset for characterizing real and fictional planetary systems based on known system properties, it is primarily intended for use as a worldbuilding tool to generate scientifically accurate environments for games, movies, novels and other projects, but it can also be used as an educational tool as well.

## Goals

The Workbench is developed with the following basic goals in mind:

 * *Portablility:* The Workbench core is written to maximize portability between a variety of platforms including Windows, GNU/Linux, macOS, Solaris, AIX, IRIX and beyond.
 * *Modular design:* Interchangeable graphical and textual front-ends further improve portability. User-made module support is also planned for future releases.
 * *Accuracy:* Scientific accuracy (within reason) is a priority whenever possible, to ensure the most plausible results.

## Features

The workbench will be able to infer a number of properties based on known data, entries in the following list that have been crossed out have been implemented:

* ~~Orbital characterization~~ *(5/8/17)*
	* ~~Semimajor axis~~ *(5/4/17)*
	* ~~Orbital period~~ *(5/4/17)*
	* ~~Eccentricity~~ *(5/8/17)*
	* ~~Perihelion/aphelion distances~~ *(5/8/17)*
* Climate characterization
	* Baseline equilibrium, periastron, aphelion temperatures
* Physical characterization
	* Mass
	* Radius
	* Density
	* Hill sphere
	* Roche limit
	* Tidal lock probability

In addition, the workbench aims to provide (more ambitious) tools for reasonable speculation on the following characteristics:

* Rotation period and tidal locking
* Natural satellites
* Axial tilt and seasons
* Composition (partially derived from host metallicity)
* Atmospheric composition
* Greenhouse effect and climate
* Weather conditions
* Surface conditions
* Probability of life and biosphere maturity
* Human habitability

Lastly, the workbench also aims to include tools of use to worldbuilders in the future, such as:
* Local calendar generation based on orbital, rotational and seasonal characteristics
* Surface map generation
* Cloud/weather simulation
