# Planetary Workbench

The Planetary Workbench is a multi-platform toolset for characterizing real and fictional planetary systems based on known system properties, it is primarily intended for use as a worldbuilding tool to generate scientifically accurate environments for games, movies, novels and other projects, but it can also be used as an educational tool as well.

## Goals

The Workbench is developed with the following basic goals in mind:

 * *Portablility:* The Workbench core is written to maximize portability between a variety of platforms including Windows, GNU/Linux, macOS, Solaris, AIX, IRIX and beyond.
 * *Modular design:* Interchangeable graphical and textual front-ends further improve portability. User-made module support is also planned for future releases.
 * *Accuracy:* Scientific accuracy (within reason) is a priority whenever possible, to ensure the most plausible results.

## Features

The Workbench aims to implement the following features, which may be subject to updates or changes:

### Inferrence of basic properties

These basic properties can all be directly observed or concretely inferred based on other characteristics:

* Orbital characterization
	* Semimajor axis
	* Orbital period
	* Eccentricity
	* Inclination
	* Perihelion/aphelion distances
* Climate characterization
	* Baseline equilibrium, periastron, aphelion temperatures
* Physical characterization
	* Mass
	* Radius
	* Density
	* Hill sphere
	* Roche limit
	* Tidal lock probability
